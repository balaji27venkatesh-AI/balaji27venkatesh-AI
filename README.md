<!-- ## 🎯 What I Bring to the Table -->
## 🎯 Profile Summary

I'm a **Senior Analytics Engineer with strong product exposure**, experienced in building **decision-grade analytics systems** that directly influence revenue, experimentation, and AI-powered product decisions.

I've owned analytics end-to-end across **large-scale eCommerce (Dell), manufacturing (HCLTech)**, working closely with product, engineering, and business teams. My focus is **impact over dashboards** — metrics people trust, experiments that guide decisions, and systems that scale.


**Track Record:**
- 💰 Supported ML features generating **$10M+ incremental revenue** (Dell eCommerce)
- 📈 Drove **+6% YoY revenue mix growth** through data-driven segmentation (Dell)
- ⚡ Improved data processing efficiency by **~30%** through optimized transformations (HCLTech)
- 🤖 Delivered **15+ AI automation deployments** saving **120+ man-hours** (Wipro)

I'm now **transitioning toward Applied AI Engineering**, with a system-first mindset: evaluation, reliability, iteration, and business alignment of AI systems.

## 🔑 Core Strengths

**Analytics Engineering at Scale**
- SQL-first modeling, dbt-style transformations, semantic layers
- Built production data models serving 200+ stakeholders, eliminating metric drift
- Designed analytics infrastructure supporting multi-million dollar decisions

**Product & Experimentation Analytics**
- A/B testing, funnel analysis, guardrail metrics, conversion optimization
- Led experiments across ML-powered features and web journeys
- Improved key metrics: 70% → 85% cart conversion rates, +5% CSAT improvements

**Applied AI Enablement**
- Supporting ML/AI features through rigorous evaluation and experimentation
- Currently building production-oriented AI projects: LLMs, RAG, agent systems (work-in-progress)
- Focus on AI as a **product feature**, not just a model

**Decision Ownership**
- Translating ambiguous business problems into measurable outcomes
- End-to-end ownership from data modeling to stakeholder decision-making
- Production mindset: reliability, performance, documentation, stakeholder trust

---

## 🚀 Current Focus (2026 Trajectory)

Designing **AI-powered features as systems**, not demos:
- Prompt & system design aligned to business intent
- Evaluation frameworks for relevance, faithfulness, and usefulness
- Strengthening Python, ML fundamentals, and LLM workflows with production thinking

My GitHub reflects this journey through **deliberate, system-oriented portfolio work**.
